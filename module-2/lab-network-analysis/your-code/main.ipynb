We can analyze the data at a higher level if we wanted to, strippping out the players as entities and analyzing the data at the Games level. To do this, we would need to reconstruct the graph so that the *Games* field represents the entities and then use the player names as the edge criteria so that there would be an edge between two Olympic games if an player played in both of them. You already have the tools in your toolbox to be able to do this, so give it a try. "
