# NUMBER 2 : Tableau - Dataviz on UFC data


## Overview

Dataset was provided by Kaggle dataset 'UFC-Fight historical data from 1993 to 2019' by Rajeev Warrier.
The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts promotion company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, that is owned and operated by parent company William Morris Endeavor. It is the largest MMA promotion company in the world and features the highest-level fighters on the roster.

There are 14 sheets displaying:



#### 1) Main location is Las Vegas, Nevada

No. of records were displayed for each location where an UFC event took place. Records were sorted from the highest to the lowest. Las Vegas is obviously the place with more events than anywhere else. There are 1544 records in the dataset.


#### 2) Total number of fights in UFC from 1993 to 2019

This a time series of No. of fights occuring from 1993 to 2019. A high increase can be observed starting in 2004 on the curve.

At this point, with increased visibility, the UFC's pay-per-view buy numbers exploded. UFC 52, the first event featuring eventual-UFC Hall of Famer Chuck "The Iceman" Liddell avenging his defeat to fellow eventual-Hall of Famer Randy Couture, drew a pay-per-view audience of 300,000, doubling its previous benchmark of 150,000 set at UFC 40. Following the second season of The Ultimate Fighter, the UFC's much-hyped match between Liddell and Couture drew an estimated 410,000 pay-per-view buys at UFC 57.

For the rest of 2006, pay-per-view buy rates continued to skyrocket, with 620,000 buys for UFC 60: Hughes vs. Gracie—featuring Royce Gracie's first UFC fight in 11 years—and 775,000 buys for UFC 61 featuring the highly anticipated rematch between Ken Shamrock and Tito Ortiz, the coaches of The Ultimate Fighter 3.

The surge in popularity prompted the UFC to beef up its executive team. In March 2006, the UFC announced that it had hired Marc Ratner, former Executive Director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. Ratner became a catalyst for the emergence of sanctioned mixed martial arts in the United States. Ratner lobbied numerous athletic commissions to help raise the UFC's media profile in an attempt to legalize mixed martial arts in jurisdictions inside and outside the United States that had yet to sanction the sport.

On November 16, 2012, the eve of UFC 154: St. Pierre vs. Condit, Dana White confirmed with Jim Rome the UFC would feature women's MMA with the signing of its first female fighter, Strikeforce bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey


#### 3) Proportion of stances in (Red corner)

#### 4) Proportion of stances in (Blue corner)

Orthodox are obviously in majority in terms of number of fights in both red and blue corner.


#### 5) Number of fights in each weight class

Lightweight (146 lbs) and Welterweight (156 lbs) show the highest number of fights, followed by Middleweight (171 lbs). We see a clear unequal number of fights in weight classes. 


#### 6) Number of wins between stances combinations

'Winner' dimension wad filtered to 'win'. Number of wins were given for every stance combination found in the dataset.


#### 7) Number of fights of UFC fighters

#### 8) No of times UFC fighters met each other

#### 9) Weight class and average fight statistics (women weight class included)
#### 10) A selection of fighters (red corner): average of GROUND attack landed
#### 11) A selection of fighters (red corner): average of attack landed
